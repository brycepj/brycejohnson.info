Hi, my name is Bryce. Welcome to my little corner of the Internet ðŸ‘‹

I'm a husband to Rachael and a dad to Emmy. We live on a farm in Virginia with our two cats, Ruby and Steve.

I work remotely as a software engineer for HireVue and was formerly a software engineer at GitLab.

At work, I'm happiest when I'm breaking down sticky problems into small actionable tasks. Lately I've been learning a lot about how to write software that's accessible for people with disabilities, which I've found both interesting and meaningful.

Glad you stopped by. Feel free to reach out to me through email, at <a mailto='10be8b47@opayq.com'>10be8b47@opayq.com</a>
