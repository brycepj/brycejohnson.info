Hello, my name is Bryce. I'm the husband of Rachael and dad of Emma.

We live on a farm in Virginia with our cats, Ruby and Steve. I work remotely as a senior frontend engineer at HireVue, and worked previously at GitLab and at two other startups.

In my spare time, I like to make things with code, help with open source projects and write about programming. I also enjoy gardening, vermiculture (google it!), working on my car, cooking, and listening to music.

Feel free to reach out to me through email, at reveal
