Hi, my name is Bryce. Welcome to my little corner of the Internet ðŸ‘‹

I'm a husband to Rachael and a dad to Emmy. We all live on a farm outside of Charlottesville, Virginia with our two cats, Ruby and Steve.

I work remotely as a software engineer for HireVue and before that, I worked for GitLab as a frontend engineer.

At work, I'm happiest when I'm breaking down sticky problems into small actionable tasks. Don't ask me why, but I also really like pretty much any kind of debugging. Lately I've been learning a lot about how to write software that's accessible for people with disabilities, which I've found both interesting and meaningful.

In my spare time I like hanging with my wife and daughter, making things with code, gardening, and working on my car. I tend to ask people a lot of questions and I enjoy any speculative, handwavy philosophical discussion, especially if I can find a way to bring it around to communism.

Well, thanks for reading. Glad you stopped by. Feel free to reach out to me through email, at <a mailto='10be8b47@opayq.com'>10be8b47@opayq.com</a>
